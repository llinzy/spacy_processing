 While most installations are in buildings partially or fully enclosed to protect from sun, wind and rain, they are often installed before air conditioning, heat, or permanent light fixtures. Other projects will require work to be performed outside in varying weather conditions. Some work is in completed structures currently in use.
 Backbone voice and data cables are routed between the entrance facility (where communications signals enter a building) to equipment rooms and telephone rooms. Voice and data horizontal cables are routed between telephone rooms or equipment rooms and individual workstations throughout the building. Equipment rooms often contain energized equipment such as hubs, file servers, electrical panels or telephone switches. In some cases these devices are configured and connected to equipment that currently serves the building and must not be interrupted. Any questions regarding how a system goes together or works must be immediately brought to the attention of the foreman.
 The Foreman oversees and participates in the installation voice, data, video, and fire devices at the time of trim in designated locations as identified on the approved plans/layouts. Additionally, they install punch down blocks and cross connects in telephone rooms when required. These may be wall mounted or rack mounted, and must be grouped and identified according to specific installation standards. Whether the work is new construction or in existing office or manufacturing spaces, the craftsmen takes pride in the work he/she has performed. All testing required to insure the installation was properly completed must be done to avoid return repair or quality control visits."

39781,Installation.xls,"About
 The most secretive of Navy vessels, a submarine requires a select community of specially trained professionals to operate its classified, highly advanced hardware. The Sailors in the Submarine Electronics Computer Field (SECF) work with a submarine’s sonar, weapons, communications and navigation systems. The training is rigorous and the career opportunities are equally impressive.
 
More Information
 
Responsibilities
 Within Submarine Electronics, there are four distinct focus areas that have their own training paths and job descriptions.
 
Fire Control Technician (FT)
 
FTs operate, test and maintain submarine combat control systems. They participate in weapons handling functions and operate and maintain non-tactical computer systems and peripherals. They are responsible for a huge array of weapons, which may include torpedoes, Tomahawk® cruise missiles and even nuclear ballistic missiles capable of reaching anywhere in the world.
 
Sonar Technician, Submarine (STS)
 
STSs specialize in underwater acoustic technologies. They operate a submarine’s sonar, oceanographic equipment, and auxiliary sonar to conduct underwater surveillance, collect scientific data and track enemy targets. They also perform maintenance on the highly sensitive, highly classified sonar hardware.
 
Electronics Technician (ET/RF AND ET/NAV)
 
ETs focus on installing, administering and maintaining onboard communications and navigations systems. ET/RFs work with and maintain submarine radio communication equipment, systems and programs (including submarine LAN systems). ET/NAVs specialize in submarine navigation and radio equipment, systems and programs.
 
There are also electronics careers that require advanced nuclear training and involve working with nuclear reactor control, propulsion and power generation on Navy nuclear-powered submarines or aircraft carriers. Learn about opportunities in nuclear operations.
 
Work Environment
 As a Navy Submarine electronics specialist, you may serve at sea or ashore, operating and repairing systems and equipment on Navy submarines at bases, ports of call, or while underway in undisclosed ocean waters. Since deployments are secret and stealthy, your time in a submarine may last for several months, sometimes with little or no time on the surface.
 
Training & Advancement
 Upon completion of initial 7–9 week Recruit Training (known as Boot Camp), those pursuing positions in the Navy submarine electronics field report to Basic Enlisted Submarine School in Groton, Conn., for 4 weeks instruction in basic submarine systems. From there, Sailors attend “A” School in Groton, Conn., to receive formal Navy schooling in their specialty area. There they receive extensive training in electricity, electronics, computers, digital systems, fiber optics and electronics repair.
 
“A” School for FTs – This 27- to 33-week course in Groton, Conn., provides a basic knowledge of electronics, mathematics and computer theory to support the operation and basic maintenance of submarine weapons control systems. It includes group instruction and training in practical application and equipment labs. Further training may be received at a “C” School that provides learning in advanced maintenance, TLAM (Tomahawk® Land-Attack Missile) Strike and both computer and computer language skills, including maintenance, operations and security of systems operated and maintained.
 
“A” School for STSs – This 18-week course in Groton, Conn., provides a basic knowledge of electrical skills, electronics, computers and sonar fundamentals. It includes group instruction and training in practical application and equipment labs. Further training may be received at a “C” School that provides advanced maintenance instruction on specific equipment as well as Advanced Oceanography and Acoustic Intelligence Analysis.
 
“A” School for ETs (ET/RF and ET/NAV) – This nine-week course in Groton, Conn., provides a basic knowledge of electricity, electronics and technical computer skills. This is immediately followed by a 14–28-week course – in either Groton, Conn.; Kings Bay, Ga.; or Bangor, Wash. – that provides further training specific to the communications (ET/RF) or navigations (ET/NAV) specialty, as well as assignment to a fast attack or ballistic missile submarine. The course includes group instruction and training in practical application and equipment labs. Further training may be received at a “C” School that provides advanced maintenance instruction on specific equipment.
 
Navy Nuclear Field (NF) Program

DEFINITION 
 
Under general supervision or direction, maintains facility security and ensures inmate welfare in a County Jail; oversees and directs the work of inmates in structured situations and the community during an assigned shift; prepares clear, accurate, and comprehensive reports and other written materials; maintains accurate records, logs, and files; and performs related duties as assigned. 
 
 SUPERVISION RECEIVED AND EXERCISED 
 
Receives general supervision or direction from the Sheriff's Correctional Sergeant. Exercises no direct supervision over staff. Sheriff's Correctional Officer II incumbents assigned to function as jail training officers and officers-in-charge exercise direct supervision over staff. 
 
 CLASS CHARACTERISTICS 
 
 Sheriff's Correctional Officer I:  This is the entry-level classification in the Sheriff's Correctional Officer series. Under general supervision, incumbents learn and perform varied duties related to the operation of jail facilities. As experience is gained, assignments become more varied, complex, and difficult; close supervision and frequent review of work lessen as an incumbent demonstrates skill to perform the work independently. Positions at this level usually perform most of the duties required of the positions at the II-level, but are not expected to function at the same skill level and usually exercise less independent discretion and judgment in matters related to work procedures and methods. Work is usually supervised while in progress and fits an established structure or pattern. Exceptions or changes in procedures are explained in detail as they arise. 
 
 Sheriff's Correctional Officer II : This is the fully qualified journey-level classification in the Sheriff's Correctional Officer series. Positions at this level are distinguished from the Sheriff's Correctional Officer I by the performance of the full range of duties as assigned, working independently, and exercising judgment and initiative. Positions at this level receive only occasional instruction or assistance as new or unusual situations arise and are fully aware of the operating procedures and policies of the work unit. 
 
Sheriff's Correctional Officer I/II incumbents are public officers as defined in California Penal Code Section 831.5 and are not assigned to patrol duties. 
 
Positions in the Sheriff's Correctional Officer class series are flexibly staffed and Sheriff's Correctional Officer II positions are normally filled by advancement from I-level, after gaining the knowledge, skill, and experience which meet the qualifications for and after demonstrating the ability to perform the work of the higher-level class.

39975,Installation.xls,"About
 The most secretive of Navy vessels, a submarine requires a select community of specially trained professionals to operate its classified, highly advanced hardware. The Sailors in the Submarine Electronics Computer Field (SECF) work with a submarine’s sonar, weapons, communications and navigation systems. The training is rigorous and the career opportunities are equally impressive.
 
More Information
 
Responsibilities
 Within Submarine Electronics, there are four distinct focus areas that have their own training paths and job descriptions.
 
Fire Control Technician (FT)
 
FTs operate, test and maintain submarine combat control systems. They participate in weapons handling functions and operate and maintain non-tactical computer systems and peripherals. They are responsible for a huge array of weapons, which may include torpedoes, Tomahawk® cruise missiles and even nuclear ballistic missiles capable of reaching anywhere in the world.
 
Sonar Technician, Submarine (STS)
 
STSs specialize in underwater acoustic technologies. They operate a submarine’s sonar, oceanographic equipment, and auxiliary sonar to conduct underwater surveillance, collect scientific data and track enemy targets. They also perform maintenance on the highly sensitive, highly classified sonar hardware.
 
Electronics Technician (ET/RF AND ET/NAV)
 
ETs focus on installing, administering and maintaining onboard communications and navigations systems. ET/RFs work with and maintain submarine radio communication equipment, systems and programs (including submarine LAN systems). ET/NAVs specialize in submarine navigation and radio equipment, systems and programs.
 
There are also electronics careers that require advanced nuclear training and involve working with nuclear reactor control, propulsion and power generation on Navy nuclear-powered submarines or aircraft carriers. Learn about opportunities in nuclear operations.
 
Work Environment
 As a Navy Submarine electronics specialist, you may serve at sea or ashore, operating and repairing systems and equipment on Navy submarines at bases, ports of call, or while underway in undisclosed ocean waters. Since deployments are secret and stealthy, your time in a submarine may last for several months, sometimes with little or no time on the surface.
 
Training & Advancement
 Upon completion of initial 7–9 week Recruit Training (known as Boot Camp), those pursuing positions in the Navy submarine electronics field report to Basic Enlisted Submarine School in Groton, Conn., for 4 weeks instruction in basic submarine systems. From there, Sailors attend “A” School in Groton, Conn., to receive formal Navy schooling in their specialty area. There they receive extensive training in electricity, electronics, computers, digital systems, fiber optics and electronics repair.
 
“A” School for FTs – This 27- to 33-week course in Groton, Conn., provides a basic knowledge of electronics, mathematics and computer theory to support the operation and basic maintenance of submarine weapons control systems. It includes group instruction and training in practical application and equipment labs. Further training may be received at a “C” School that provides learning in advanced maintenance, TLAM (Tomahawk® Land-Attack Missile) Strike and both computer and computer language skills, including maintenance, operations and security of systems operated and maintained.
 
“A” School for STSs – This 18-week course in Groton, Conn., provides a basic knowledge of electrical skills, electronics, computers and sonar fundamentals. It includes group instruction and training in practical application and equipment labs. Further training may be received at a “C” School that provides advanced maintenance instruction on specific equipment as well as Advanced Oceanography and Acoustic Intelligence Analysis.
 
“A” School for ETs (ET/RF and ET/NAV) – This nine-week course in Groton, Conn., provides a basic knowledge of electricity, electronics and technical computer skills. This is immediately followed by a 14–28-week course – in either Groton, Conn.; Kings Bay, Ga.; or Bangor, Wash. – that provides further training specific to the communications (ET/RF) or navigations (ET/NAV) specialty, as well as assignment to a fast attack or ballistic missile submarine. The course includes group instruction and training in practical application and equipment labs. Further training may be received at a “C” School that provides advanced maintenance instruction on specific equipment.
 
Navy Nuclear Field (NF) Program
 
To learn more about the additional training involved with becoming a nuclear-trained ET, refer to the Navy Nuclear Field (NF) Program section on the nuclear operations page.
 
Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunitiesin related fields.
 
To learn more about the specific training path for any of the focus areas within the field of submarine electronics, locate a recruiter.
 
Education Opportunities
 Beyond offering access to professional credentials and certifications, Navy technical and operational training in the field of submarine electronics can translate to credit hours toward a bachelor’s or associate degree through the American Council on Education. You may also continue your education through opportunities like the following:
 
Navy College Program and Tuition Assistance
 Post-9/11 GI Bill
 
Qualifications & Requirements
 A high school diploma or equivalent is required to become an Enlisted Sailor in the Submarine Electronics field in the Navy. Those seeking a position in this community must be U.S. citizens who can meet eligibility requirements for a security clearance.

 By the very nature of their duties, Navy Nurses quickly rise to the top of their profession. They provide care, not only for military servicemembers and their families, but also for people in need around the globe.
 
Working with a team of talented colleagues united by a common mission, Navy Nurses have the opportunity to educate, lead and shape policy within Navy Health Care. They also:
 
Apply leading-edge medical advances at world-class hospitals
 Utilize some of the most advanced technology on the planet, such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), which can lead to less paperwork and more meaningful patient care
 Work at the best military nursing facilities on shore, at sea and in the field
 More Information
 
Responsibilities
 As an active duty Navy Nurse, you’ll provide high-quality nursing care, doing everything a typical nurse would do in a variety of settings:
 
Military treatment facilities (in the U.S. and overseas)
 Austere environments (i.e. deployments, humanitarian aid missions)
 Onboard ships (aircraft carriers, hospital ships)
 Nursing in an austere environment could mean taking part in humanitarian relief efforts, such as administering infant vaccinations in developing countries, or providing emergency care to victims of a natural disaster. Navy Nurses collaborate with physicians, surgeons, cardiologists and fellow nurses as colleagues and equals. Navy Nursing provides opportunities to develop leadership skills that will set you apart.
 
As a Navy Reserve Nurse, you’ll provide high-quality nursing care, doing everything a typical nurse would do in a variety of settings.
 
You also have the opportunity to step outside of your comfort zone by taking part in humanitarian relief efforts, such as administering infant vaccinations in developing countries, or providing emergency care to victims of a natural disaster. Navy Nurses collaborate with physicians, surgeons, cardiologists and fellow nurses as colleagues and equals, while developing leadership skills that will set you apart.
 
Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.
 
Work Environment
 Active Duty Navy Nurses may serve at any one of more than 250 Navy and medical facilities around the globe, from Hawaii to Japan, Germany to Guam, and Washington, D.C., to Washington state.
 
As a Navy Nurse, you could work at one of the highly acclaimed National Naval Medical Centers in Bethesda, Md.; Portsmouth, Va.; and San Diego, Calif. Or you could provide medical support aboard one of two dedicated hospital ships: the USNS Comfort and USNS Mercy.
 
More opportunities are available stateside and abroad – aboard a surface ship, working closely with a nearby aircraft squadron, or even with the Fleet Marine Force.
 
Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Nurses in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes. This gives you the flexibility to expand your nursing experience in the Navy, while continuing and enhancing your civilian career at home.
 
For annual training, nurses may serve anywhere in the world, whether at sea, in hospitals stateside, or in bases and camps in other countries.
 
Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.
 
Training & Advancement
 Upon commissioning, Navy Nurses are required to attend Officer Development School (ODS) in Newport, R.I. ODS is a five-week program that provides a comprehensive and intense introduction to the responsibilities of Navy Staff Corps Officers. They will learn about the military structure of the U.S. Navy, its rich history of traditions and customs, leadership development and military etiquette.
 
Promotion opportunities are regularly available, but are competitive and based on performance.
 
Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent.
 
Nurses in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Before receiving the ongoing professional training that comes with this job, initial training requirements must first be met.
 
 For current or former Navy Officers (NAVET):  Prior experience satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.
 
For current or former Officers of military branches other than the Navy (OSVET), as well as for Officer candidates without prior military experience: Beginning October 1st, 2019, Officer Candidates will be required to attend the Officer Development School (ODS) in Newport, RI instead of the 12-day Direct Commission Officer School. ODS is a five-week program that provides a comprehensive and intense introduction to the responsibilities of Navy Staff Corps Officers. Here you will learn about the military structure of the U.S. Navy, its rich history of traditions and customs, leadership development and military etiquette. There may be an option for attendees to request to split the five-week program into two sessions.
 
With flexible training options, Nurses in the Navy Reserve can comfortably balance civilian and military schedules. You can maintain your own life and your own practice – enriching both with the rewarding work you do for others.
 
The Navy Nurse Corps offers a truly diverse variety of academic, clinical and operational settings in which to practice. In some cases, you can even work in the same civilian setting you work in now. What’s more, you will enjoy an unrivaled sense of pride and fulfillment known only to those who serve.

Through a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) Nurse Option scholarship, the Navy can cover the full cost – up to $180,000 – of your nursing education at some of the best colleges and universities in the country.

39986,Installation.xls,"About
 The most secretive of Navy vessels, a submarine requires a select community of specially trained professionals to operate its classified, highly advanced hardware. The Sailors in the Submarine Electronics Computer Field (SECF) work with a submarine’s sonar, weapons, communications and navigation systems. The training is rigorous and the career opportunities are equally impressive.
 
More Information
 
Responsibilities
 Within Submarine Electronics, there are four distinct focus areas that have their own training paths and job descriptions.
 
Fire Control Technician (FT)
 
FTs operate, test and maintain submarine combat control systems. They participate in weapons handling functions and operate and maintain non-tactical computer systems and peripherals. They are responsible for a huge array of weapons, which may include torpedoes, Tomahawk® cruise missiles and even nuclear ballistic missiles capable of reaching anywhere in the world.
 
Sonar Technician, Submarine (STS)
 
STSs specialize in underwater acoustic technologies. They operate a submarine’s sonar, oceanographic equipment, and auxiliary sonar to conduct underwater surveillance, collect scientific data and track enemy targets. They also perform maintenance on the highly sensitive, highly classified sonar hardware.
 
Electronics Technician (ET/RF AND ET/NAV)
 
ETs focus on installing, administering and maintaining onboard communications and navigations systems. ET/RFs work with and maintain submarine radio communication equipment, systems and programs (including submarine LAN systems). ET/NAVs specialize in submarine navigation and radio equipment, systems and programs.
 
There are also electronics careers that require advanced nuclear training and involve working with nuclear reactor control, propulsion and power generation on Navy nuclear-powered submarines or aircraft carriers. Learn about opportunities in nuclear operations.
 
Work Environment
 As a Navy Submarine electronics specialist, you may serve at sea or ashore, operating and repairing systems and equipment on Navy submarines at bases, ports of call, or while underway in undisclosed ocean waters. Since deployments are secret and stealthy, your time in a submarine may last for several months, sometimes with little or no time on the surface.
 
Training & Advancement
 Upon completion of initial 7–9 week Recruit Training (known as Boot Camp), those pursuing positions in the Navy submarine electronics field report to Basic Enlisted Submarine School in Groton, Conn., for 4 weeks instruction in basic submarine systems. From there, Sailors attend “A” School in Groton, Conn., to receive formal Navy schooling in their specialty area. There they receive extensive training in electricity, electronics, computers, digital systems, fiber optics and electronics repair.
 
“A” School for FTs – This 27- to 33-week course in Groton, Conn., provides a basic knowledge of electronics, mathematics and computer theory to support the operation and basic maintenance of submarine weapons control systems. It includes group instruction and training in practical application and equipment labs. Further training may be received at a “C” School that provides learning in advanced maintenance, TLAM (Tomahawk® Land-Attack Missile) Strike and both computer and computer language skills, including maintenance, operations and security of systems operated and maintained.
 
“A” School for STSs – This 18-week course in Groton, Conn., provides a basic knowledge of electrical skills, electronics, computers and sonar fundamentals. It includes group instruction and training in practical application and equipment labs. Further training may be received at a “C” School that provides advanced maintenance instruction on specific equipment as well as Advanced Oceanography and Acoustic Intelligence Analysis.
 
“A” School for ETs (ET/RF and ET/NAV) – This nine-week course in Groton, Conn., provides a basic knowledge of electricity, electronics and technical computer skills. This is immediately followed by a 14–28-week course – in either Groton, Conn.; Kings Bay, Ga.; or Bangor, Wash. – that provides further training specific to the communications (ET/RF) or navigations (ET/NAV) specialty, as well as assignment to a fast attack or ballistic missile submarine. The course includes group instruction and training in practical application and equipment labs. Further training may be received at a “C” School that provides advanced maintenance instruction on specific equipment.
 
Navy Nuclear Field (NF) Program
 
To learn more about the additional training involved with becoming a nuclear-trained ET, refer to the Navy Nuclear Field (NF) Program section on the nuclear operations page.
 
Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunitiesin related fields.
 
To learn more about the specific training path for any of the focus areas within the field of submarine electronics, locate a recruiter.
