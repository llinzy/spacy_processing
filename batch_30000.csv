 About The Goddard School of Huntingdon Valley: 
 
 The philosophy of The Goddard School is that children learn through play. Our F.L.EX.® Learning Program (Fun Learning Experience) is based on academic research that shows children experience the deepest, most genuine learning when they are having fun.Play allows children to imagine and experience new situations and learn from them. When children play house, they can safely try on the roles of parents or spouses. This type of play develops empathy, communication skills and the ability to solve problems creatively.Play involves experimenting with different activities, such as drawing or sculpting with modeling clay. Engaging in these playful activities helps children become more creative, which helps them learn how to solve different problems.When children participate in a wide variety of high-quality play experiences, they are better prepared for life. This is why The Goddard School is the best childhood preparation for social and academic success; we ensure children have fun while learning the skills they need to become school-ready, career-ready and life-ready."

29433,Active_Listening.xls,"Description of Opportunity:  Are you ready to shape the future? If so, leading a classroom could be exactly what you’re looking for in your next career – and you could be doing it sooner than you think! Here in Colorado, you can enter the classroom  while  getting your teacher license. That means you don’t need to have a license to apply for a teaching job today. So, how exactly does this work? You apply for an open teaching position in a school district in Colorado. If that district is considering unlicensed candidates for that position – typically in rural areas or in subject areas like math, science, special education, and foreign languages – they will reach out to you for next steps. Once you go through the interview process and get offered the job, your new district will help enroll you in a local alternative teacher training program. As a teacher of record, you’ll earn a full teacher’s salary and benefits while you are working towards your license. Additionally, some districts will cover some or all of your training costs. So why should you pursue your alternative teaching license? Teaching is a rewarding profession that allows you to make a difference in the world, all while building your professional skill set. It is a profession of possibility. To be a teacher is to be a problem solver, a poet, an inventor, a creator, an explorer, and more. Experience the possibility of untangling a student’s understanding of numbers, of awakening curiosities that shift life trajectories, or of creating social change. If you want to make a dent in this world, teaching could be for you. Teaching allows you to innovate. The field of education is active with debate and exploration about how to ensure schools best serve kids, from concepts like Personalized Learning and Instructional Leadership, to new approaches like Maker Spaces and coding labs. As you progress in your career, you’ll have plenty of fodder to keep you stimulated intellectually and challenged professionally. Qualifications:  To take advantage of Colorado’s policy, you need to have a bachelor’s degree in a field of study related to the subject you’re looking to teach. Colorado is interested particularly in high-need areas. So, if you have a degree in a STEM field or a foreign language or live in a rural area and you’re looking for a career change, teaching might be for you. Apart from a bachelor’s degree, you’ll need a few other things: A strong work ethic. As a teacher you’ll work hard, yes, but this is a job where your investment is sure to pay off. For every hour you put in, every exam you administer, every lesson you teach, every pep talk you give, you will reap unparalleled outcomes. Your students will light up when they master the subjects you’ve taught them to love. You’ll establish bonds of trust that allow you to influence their lives. And you’ll get to work with subject matter that interests you. Nobody likes to be bored, and as a teacher, you won’t have that problem. High expectations for all students. If you believe that your students can run a NASA command center, manage a corporate boardroom, thrive in a laboratory, master an art studio, succeed in an operating room—so will they. In the classroom, your influence impacts their dreams and sense of curiosity. Teaching allows you to constantly imagine new and effective ways to reach young minds. A diverse set of skills: leadership, creative problem-solving, and stellar communication, to name a few. The practice of teaching will help you deepen your talents to increase your influence and professional abilities. How to Apply:  TEACH is here to help you navigate this process. We can help connect you to the districts and schools that are looking for teachers and guide you through the job application process. With these two pieces in place, you can be a teacher of record as early as this fall. Interested in learning more or pursuing this path?

29659,Active_Listening.xls,"BACKGROUND 
 
David Teiger assembled a brilliant and distinctive collection of contemporary art with fiercely independent judgment and a keen eye. He reveled in the discovery of visionary creative talents, and championed those arts institutions and professionals especially curators who pursued bold and pioneering paths in exhibition making and writing. Having devoted the majority of his life to celebrating artistic expression at its highest level, Teiger chose to similarly dedicate significant assets from his estate. With his passing in 2014, it was announced that the disposition of his entire collection would benefit the ongoing advancement of cultural production, interpretation, and experience. Per Teiger's wishes, outright gifts of select pieces were made to public institutions and almost all were sold, with a few in process, to enable the endowing of Teiger Foundation whose founding purpose was to encourage and support excellence and innovation among artists, curators, and writers working in the field. 
 
David Teiger was widely known for both meticulous looking and clarity of vision. He insisted on reaching for the truly exceptional and placed a premium on ""best in type,"" ""mastery of materials,"" and the promise of ongoing resonance and impact. While he moved among an elite cadre of international arts patrons and professionals, David was ever his own most demanding judge and jury. And he especially recognized the challenges that both artists and curators face when following a resolute but perhaps ""difficult"" path. In fact, David drew considerable inspiration from his close relationship to curators and placed a premium on empowering them to pursue their creative and intellectual visions without regard to inherent institutional resistance toward work considered challenging, difficult, controversial, or ""unfundable."" 
 
To honor that spirit, Teiger Foundation has been conceived as David's lasting gesture of empowerment to those talents whose particular creative investigations and pursuits demand a rare degree of rigor, conviction, and tenacity. The Foundation seeks to be a bold, imaginative, and enabling force in the field, shaped by a driving ethos to be international, responsive, agile, and unencumbered by bureaucracy so far as foundation protocols and practices allow. 
 
TEIGER FOUNDATION: PROGRAMS AND PRIORITIES 
 
While David chose not to specify the precise programs to be undertaken by the Foundation in his name, its incorporating trustees believe that the purpose and parameters of the fund should reflect David's utmost values, highest aspirations, and impeccable standards. The Foundation Board of four is chaired by David's personally chosen associates Joel Wachs, John Silberman, Gary Garrels, and Kati Lovaas. 
 
The Teiger Foundation has identified the following areas of primary focus, all which must pertain to the field of contemporary art: 
 
A. Curatorial Initiatives 
 
 Exhibition development, realization, interpretation, and documentation 
 Production and presentation of visual art in all its forms, including time-based media 
 Curatorial research, travel, professional development, and sabbaticals 
 Acquisitions 
 
 B. Arts Writing 
 
The Foundation will predominately channel its support of arts professionals and programs under the auspices of qualified not-for-profit institutions as opposed to funding individual artists or independent curators. Arts writers will be supported through their respective not-for-profit publications or through those regranting agreement(s) that Teiger Foundation establishes with select not-for-profit peers it deems appropriate. While the Foundation recognizes and appreciates the importance of institutional stability, it will not provide support for general operating expenses, endowments, capital or infrastructural needs, conservation, or capacity building. It will, however, consider emergency requests on a case-by-case basis. 
 
 
BASIC FUNCTION 
 
Reporting to the Board of Directors, the Director will provide vision, leadership, and management to the Foundation's overall operations and activities. The Director will work closely with the Board, particularly in the startup phase, to establish priorities, refine areas of programmatic interest, and develop policies and procedures. The four founding trustees of Teiger Foundation bring deep and varied sector expertise to the institution through their respective personal and professional experiences and affiliations with museum boards or committees; as art foundation leaders; in curatorial roles; as practitioners of art law; and through continuous engagement across the art world at large. Each of the trustees enjoyed longtime personal relationships with David, and he entrusted them implicitly with his legacy as a contemporary arts patron, provocateur, and catalyst. 
 
The founding trustees agree that the management model for the Foundation should be relatively lean, especially at the outset. They anticipate that the Executive Director will be fully engaged in all aspects of the operation, and oversee the grants program, including its creation and its assessment and selection processes. The individual selected for this position will also work closely with the Board to develop an overall operating plan and budget, along with shaping additional programs and the augmentation of staff when and as appropriate. There are several other important decisions that logically await the selection and input of an Executive Director. These pertain to policies and procedures around proposal vetting, as well as the selection of possible regranting partners, particularly in the category of arts writing and international curatorial grants.

 Located at: 
20280 Route 19, Second Floor
 Cranberry Township, PA 16066
 
Service Desk Consultant and Field Technician Level 1
 This job flexes between in the office remote helpdesk work and in the field project work.
 
Why Houk Consulting?
 
We are structured, focused, and driven to succeed in our mission, encouraging constant improvement for ourselves and clients. We are open and honest with each other. Everyone contributes ideas and plays a role in making it happen.
 
Be part of a growing team, loved by our clients, with many opportunities for future growth, training, and development.
 
What is This Position?
 
This position initially will have two roles.
 
Reactive Service Desk Consultant
 As a remote first line service desk consultant, you will be required to have the ability to focus intensely on one ticket at time, rapidly moving from one task to the next through the process of supporting various small business clients. The tickets are reactive in nature, meaning something needs to be fixed and a client is waiting for this to happen.
 This is a front-line position, meaning you will be answering the phone and will be the first person to work on most new tickets. Typical range of activities include new user setup, separations, fixing workstations, and fixing applications. If you are unable to solve, you will escalate to our next level support.
 Reactive support positions are an essential part of our service offering because of how directly it interacts with clients. The experience of a client’s employees will often be determined by how well we do with their reactive support, how quickly we handle it, and how positive that interaction was.
 The person in this role will work at our office in Cranberry Township, PA. You’ll primarily interact with clients over the phone or through Autotask (emails flow through the ticketing system).
 Professional Services Field Technician Level 1
 Onsite work at client locations to assist the project manager with implementation. This work includes new computer installs and assistance with server deployments.
 This requires the ability to professionally interact with client owners and executives. Clients will judge our service by the professionalism and ability displayed by our field technicians.
 Being onsite requires a get-it-done attitude. There is a set time limit to get the required activity completed, and often we are not able to come back the next day. Being able to operate comfortably in a fast paced environment, while potentially being observed by a client is critical to this role.
 
As we continue to expand, there will be growth opportunities for this person.
 
What Qualifications are Necessary?
 
This is an entry to mid level position for candidates with either a technical degree, relevant bachelor’s degree, or relevant experience. Having prior customer service positions is helpful (retail, hospitality, helpdesk, etc). Having experience at a MSP or IT internship is helpful.
 
Microsoft MCSE, MCSA, and A+ certifications are helpful but not required.
 
This position is best for people who want to support small businesses and interact with all facets of delivering IT infrastructure and cloud support to clients. Large corporate helpdesks are very limited in the scope of the work they do. This position supports small businesses and offers much more variety.
 
You must have good customer service skills and truly enjoy interacting with other people. If you prefer the nuts and bolts without social interaction, this is not the job for you. But if you enjoy the satisfaction in helping other people and meeting a need that they have, you will probably do well in this role.
 
You must have good troubleshooting skills, continue to ask why until you get to the root cause, and continue to tackle the problem from different angles until a solution is found. You should be comfortable figuring it out on your own most of the time, even if you have never seen a particular problem before. Good instincts and research skills are helpful here.
 
 Here is a list of technology you will be asked to work with:  Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, RAID, router policies, VLAN, SSLVPN, Group Policy, Azure Active Directory, Office 365 Admin, SMTP, and RDP.
 
Hours and Benefits
 
8am-5pm M-F with a rotating on-call tech; you will be part of this rotation. Benefits include vacation time, sick days, holiday time, retirement match, and healthcare benefits. Pay is based on your experience and abilities.
 
What’s it like?
 
This position will interact with the end users directly to solve technical problems. A friendly and helpful manner should come natural to you. You’ll primarily get your work through our ticket management system, Autotask. You will log your time into the ticket system directly to accommodate your entire schedule. All time is logged. Once one ticket is complete, work begins on the next highest priority ticket. Each ticket is different and requires creative problem solving.
 
You may have to adjust your priorities for the day depending on the circumstances of the issues that come in. You may need to quickly drop what you are doing and refocus on a new higher priority task without it impacting your friendliness or helpfulness.
 
This job requires a lot of focused activity throughout the day. You may also assist with proactive work and company improvements.
 
We meet once per week as a team for 60-90 minutes to review our quarterly goals, company scorecard, weekly to-dos, and solve issues as a team (based on the EOS model). We have annual state of the company meetings and quarterly company check-ins.
 
You will report to the IT Service Manager for Helpdesk work and the Director of Service Delivery for Professional Services work.
 
You’ll be an important part of our team. You will have the opportunity to contribute your unique set of skills and ideas while continually learning from the rest of the team in a broader way than is afforded at larger companies.
 
In Summary
 
If you are an energetic people person with deep curiosity, and you have the desire to be a part of a growing team where your voice can be heard, this opportunity may be for you.

About 4ocean
 
4ocean is a mission-driven for-profit business, dedicated to removing trash from our oceans and coastlines while inspiring individuals to work together for cleaner oceans.
 
Founded In 2017, 4ocean was created with the mission to sell a product that would enable the company to fund a worldwide cleanup initiative. This is how our first product, the 4ocean bracelet, was born. Made from recycled materials, every bracelet purchased funds the removal of one pound of trash from the ocean and coastlines. In less than two and a half years, we have sold enough bracelets to enable us to pull over 8 million pounds of trash from the ocean.
 
Bracelet sales are just the beginning. We are building an assortment of high quality, sustainably made products that will help people reduce their dependence on single-use plastic, reuse the materials we collect from the ocean, and celebrate the 4ocean brand and ocean-conscious lifestyle.
 
Beyond our products, we combat the ocean plastic crisis through technology, cleanups, influence, and education. We are a for-profit business, because we believe in creating sustainable, profitable business models around cleaning the ocean rather than relying on external funding. Our ocean clean-up operations, currently in the U.S., Haiti, and Indonesia, are meticulously documented and audited for transparency, and are regularly expanding to new locations and deploying new clean-up technologies. Our operations employ hundreds of people around the world, pulling trash seven days a week.

Dr. Edward Hallowell Dr. Sharon Saline Leslie Josel Elaine Taylor-Klaus & Diane Dempster Cindy Goldrich and Dr. Peg Dawson (to name a few). Even more exciting is that we’re working with other world-class ADHD experts to build an online course (https://courses.smartcourse.io/p/adhd-in-middle-school) that will help parents of kids with ADHD thrive through the notoriously difficult Middle School years. Ms. Melissa Orlov  (founder of ADHDmarriage.com, award-winning author, and leader on how ADHD affects relationships)  teaches couples, therapists, counselors and coaches about how ADHD impacts relationships and offers private counseling to couples who wish to improve their ADHD-impacted relationships. She will be teaching parents how to maintain strong family relationships while coping with ADHD through the middle school years. Dr. Concetta DeCaria  (legendary clinical neuropsychologist with a specialization in children and adolescents who's provided academic and cognitive remediation, psychotherapeutic support, and evaluation services to hundreds of individuals with difficulties in learning, attention and regulation, behavior, social, and emotional functioning since 1997)  will explain everything there is to know about diagnosing ADHD as well as any other co-morbid conditions, how they come into play, and how the results of these tests help students get the support and accommodations they need. Dr. Sarah Allen  (certified brain injury specialist, the executive director of neuropsychology at Brain Behavior Bridge, and an adjunct faculty member at Drexel University. She is also a consulting Neuropsychologist for Weisman Children's Hospital and consults for districts all over the state of New Jersey regarding brain-based program designs for public and private schools. She conducts research, teaching, and clinical neuropsychological assessments with a focus on neuro-educational programming for children in school)  will help parents gain a better understanding of the ADHD brain and how their child's unique ADHD profile will help inform which accommodations they should get in place. Dr. Sarah Wheeler  (special education teacher, counselor, and school psychologist for over a decade, specialized in helping children who are struggling to learn, socialize, or navigate their emotional world, especially children with learning disabilities, ADHD, and autism) will teach  parents everything they need to know about school accommodations and the role of a school psychologist when it comes to helping their child with ADHD. Mr. Daniel Kramarsky  ( teacher, administrator, and parent with ADHD as well as a career in education of over 30 years. He has taught teachers at Columbia University Teachers College and presented his work internationally at conferences on ethics and philosophy of education. He and his daughter, now a student at a top-notch university, both have ADHD. ) As your lead instructor and an insider with expertise on what happens in schools and families impacted by ADHD, he will be teaching you the most important things you need to know about ADHD during the middle school years and how to handle the toughest challenges you will face. As you can see, our first course is geared to help parents effectively prepare their kids with ADHD for the transition to middle school, and gain a better understanding of how to foster better relationships with the school and at home (for example we know that parent-child relationships and marriages are severely strained when raising a child with ADHD. The divorce rate is twice as high as for parents of neurotypical kids).

Although some experience in psychiatry, psychology, mental health research, special needs, and customer service is desirable, we are looking for enthusiasm, a deep desire to learn, and a commitment to the cause.

Dr. Edward Hallowell Dr. Sharon Saline Leslie Josel Elaine Taylor-Klaus & Diane Dempster Cindy Goldrich and Dr. Peg Dawson (to name a few). Even more exciting is that we’re working with other world-class ADHD experts to build an online course (https://courses.smartcourse.io/p/adhd-in-middle-school) that will help parents of kids with ADHD thrive through the notoriously difficult Middle School years. Ms. Melissa Orlov  (founder of ADHDmarriage.com, award-winning author, and leader on how ADHD affects relationships)  teaches couples, therapists, counselors and coaches about how ADHD impacts relationships and offers private counseling to couples who wish to improve their ADHD-impacted relationships. She will be teaching parents how to maintain strong family relationships while coping with ADHD through the middle school years. Dr. Concetta DeCaria  (legendary clinical neuropsychologist with a specialization in children and adolescents who's provided academic and cognitive remediation, psychotherapeutic support, and evaluation services to hundreds of individuals with difficulties in learning, attention and regulation, behavior, social, and emotional functioning since 1997)  will explain everything there is to know about diagnosing ADHD as well as any other co-morbid conditions, how they come into play, and how the results of these tests help students get the support and accommodations they need. Dr. Sarah Allen  (certified brain injury specialist, the executive director of neuropsychology at Brain Behavior Bridge, and an adjunct faculty member at Drexel University. She is also a consulting Neuropsychologist for Weisman Children's Hospital and consults for districts all over the state of New Jersey regarding brain-based program designs for public and private schools. She conducts research, teaching, and clinical neuropsychological assessments with a focus on neuro-educational programming for children in school)  will help parents gain a better understanding of the ADHD brain and how their child's unique ADHD profile will help inform which accommodations they should get in place. Dr. Sarah Wheeler  (special education teacher, counselor, and school psychologist for over a decade, specialized in helping children who are struggling to learn, socialize, or navigate their emotional world, especially children with learning disabilities, ADHD, and autism) will teach  parents everything they need to know about school accommodations and the role of a school psychologist when it comes to helping their child with ADHD. Mr. Daniel Kramarsky  ( teacher, administrator, and parent with ADHD as well as a career in education of over 30 years. He has taught teachers at Columbia University Teachers College and presented his work internationally at conferences on ethics and philosophy of education. He and his daughter, now a student at a top-notch university, both have ADHD. ) As your lead instructor and an insider with expertise on what happens in schools and families impacted by ADHD, he will be teaching you the most important things you need to know about ADHD during the middle school years and how to handle the toughest challenges you will face. As you can see, our first course is geared to help parents effectively prepare their kids with ADHD for the transition to middle school, and gain a better understanding of how to foster better relationships with the school and at home (for example we know that parent-child relationships and marriages are severely strained when raising a child with ADHD. The divorce rate is twice as high as for parents of neurotypical kids).
